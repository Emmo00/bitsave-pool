DONOT CHANGE THE STYLE OF EXISTING CODE. JUST INTEGRATE DATA WHERE NEEDED.

BUILD APP WITH `npm run build` AFTER CHANGING ANY CODE IN THIS FILE AND FIX ERRORS IF ANY.

DO NOT HARDCODE A CHAIN ID OR CONTRACT ADDRESS. ALWAYS GET IT FROM `src/contracts/config.ts` OR USING `useChainId` HOOK FROM `wagmi`.
